Purpose:  This website was created as a project for a web development class. The main goal was to create a site that felt welcoming for people who are interested in doing genealogical research at the Rubenstein Library (at Duke). It is especially meant for people who are new to archives.

View the site here: https://laurinpenland.github.io/finding-family-duke-archives.io/

Things I would like to improve:
** Soften transition of drop-down menu on hover
** Improve contrast of links in captions
** Center h2s
** Run axe audit
