  <h2>Archives at Duke may offer clues about your ancestors</h2>
  <div class="article_content">
    <p class="paragraph1">Did you know that traces of your ancestors may be found in the the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library, which is located on Duke University's West Campus?</p>
    <p>This website will teach you how to <a href="names.html">search for your ancestors</a> in the library's online catalog records and collection guides. It will also teach you how to specifically <a href="dukealumni.html">search for Duke staff and alumni</a>, how to begin <a href="enslavedancestors.html">searching for ancestors who were enslaved</a>, and how to create and <a href="diyarchive.html">perserve your own family archive</a>.</p>
    <p>Historically, Duke has collected materials (such as photographs, letters, diaries, business records, and oral histories) related to Duke history, North Carolina, the American South (especially materials related to the Civil War), as well as internationl materials. These materials are meant to be used and shared with the communities that they document.</p>
