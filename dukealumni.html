  <h2>Searching for Duke alumni and staff</h2>
  <div class="article_content">
    <p class="paragraph1">The University Archives at Duke contain many resources for finding family members who have attended or worked at Duke. Here are a few tips to start your search:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To find past students, try looking at <a href="https://archive.org/details/chanticleerseria1928duke">the digitized yearbooks</a> (<i>Chanticleer</i>), <a href="https://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/dukechronicle/">the digitized student newspaper (<i>The Duke Chronicle</i>)</a>, and <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/?f%5Bua_record_group_ssim%5D%5B%5D=31">student groups' collections</a>. </li>
      <li>To find past faculty, you could also start your search with <i>Chanticleer</i> and <i>The Duke Chronicle</i>, or just do a simple search for their <a href="names.html">names</a> in the catalog and collection guides. You could also browse the different <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/collections/ua-record-groups">record groups in University Archives</a>. "Record groups" are what they sound like--groups of records. Many different collections have been organized into larger groups so that it is easier to understand and navigate the archives as a whole. In the case of searching for faculty and staff, it may be helpful to browse <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog?f%5Bua_record_group_ssim%5D%5B%5D=29">Papers of Faculty, Staff, and Associates record group</a>.</li>
      <li>To find family members who worked at Duke as laborers and non-faculty, you will probably have to perform a more thorough search of the archives, and you may not find anything at all. Sometimes <i>Chanticleer</i> included some pictures of these workers (with and without captions). As part of a few projects at Duke, researchers have tried to find the names of past workers by going through old account books. Visit the <a href="https://stonebystone.wixsite.com/duke">Stone by Stone website</a> to view a list of workers who built the Duke Chapel.</li>
